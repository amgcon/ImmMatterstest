                    <span class="redtext">Step 1:</span> Create your Express Entry profile <br>
                    You need to meet the eligibility requirements for one of the Immigration Programs managed by Express Entry. To be eligible, you will have to fill out the forms with personal information including education, work experience, language ability (test scores), skills and other factors. If your meet the criteria, your profile will be accepted into the Express Entry pool for up to one year.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="redtext">Step 2:</span> Get an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for Permanent Resident. <br>
                    
                    Candidates will be ranked in the Express Entry pool using a points-based system called the Comprehensive Ranking System. The CRS gives you a score from the information in your profile and other factors (such as occupations in demand). Once a candidate receives an Invitation to Apply (ITA), they have 90 days to submit an application online for permanent residence with all necessary accompanying documents. According to Immigration Canada, once they have received your complete application they will process it within 6 months.
